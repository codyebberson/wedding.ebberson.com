      <h2>Wedding Party</h2>
      <h3>RITIKA KHILNANI (Maid of Honor)</h3>
      <p>
        Ritika and Reshma are sisters, friends and living examples that nature
        trumps nurture. Ritika likes things with lots of bright colors, festive
        themes and loud sounds and Reshma likes things... exactly opposite.
        Nonetheless they have endless fun cooking, doing arts and crafts,
        gossiping, and arguing as only sisters do. Reshma is proud of Ritika for
        graduating with a dual degree in Economics and Biology from University
        of Chicago in Spring 2008, and - despite the world economy crumbling-
        landing a great job at a healthcare firm in San Francisco. Reshma is
        also so thankful for Ritika's help, love and support with everything for
        the past couple decades.
      </p>
      <h3>LAURA EBBERSON</h3>
      <p>
        Besides being Reshma's friend, Laura is Cody's beloved sister. Reshma is
        very proud of Laura for all her accomplishments (she is graduating from
        University of Chicago Law School this summer, and going to work at a
        swanky New York City law firm in fall 2009), but also for her great
        sense of humor and kind, sweet disposition. Laura is proud of Reshma for
        having the good sense to marry her brother.
      </p>
      <h3>DIANA WELMERINK</h3>
      <p>
        Diana is Reshma's longtime friend from MIT, and the world's best role
        model for relationships of all kinds. After graduation, Reshma and Diana
        both moved to Seattle where they spent time getting to know each other's
        significant other, Reshma getting to know Adam, and Diana getting to
        know Cody. After seeing Adam and Diana interact, Reshma is quite sure
        she knows the secret to married life, it includes spending quality time,
        being the best of friends, and, of course, watching LOST. Diana not only
        gives her time and energy to the people in her life, she works to
        protect King County, using her MPH to prevent and track disease in the
        state of Washington.
      </p>
      <h3>TERESA ZHANG</h3>
      <p>
        Reshma and Teresa are sorority sisters and former roommates. While
        roomies at Bexley Hall, Teresa lent Reshma her winter coat for a whole
        year, fed her traditional Chinese Medicine when she got sick, and piqued
        her interest in Beijing (Teresa is a native). Teresa and Reshma share
        many things, including, but not limited to, a somewhat idealistic
        nature, love of machines/gizmos, not wasting stuff, and sweet
        sentimentalities. Teresa came to Beijing in December 2008 and January
        2009 to (among other things) visit Reshma, and they enjoyed quality time
        with friends and family and touring Microsoft Tsinghua campus. Teresa is
        getting her Ph.D. at Berkeley in Mechanical Engineering working at
        applied materials on reducing the environmental impacts of semiconductor
        manufacturing.
      </p>
      <h3>DAN WEILAND (Best Man)</h3>
      <p>
        Cody and Dan met in the Kauffman Center in the days of the J.D. Edwards
        program. As neighbors, Cody and Dan spent plenty of time distracting
        each other watching movies, playing video games, and playing the
        tape-measure game. Dan recently graduated from Full Sail University,
        pursuing his dream to become a professional animator. He now works with
        Sony Entertainment.
      </p>
      <h3>MARSHALL COMISAR</h3>
      <p>
        Marshall is another Kauffman Center neighbor and also a fraternity
        brother. While Marshall was always up for procrastinating with a game of
        foosball, he was also the responsible one who forced Cody to study on
        Saturdays. Marshall is now an engineer with Boston Scientific in
        Minneapolis. He's also an aspiring photographer and a great travel
        partner.
      </p>
      <h3>MATT ODELL</h3>
      <p>
        Matt is yet another JDE grad and also a fellow Pike. Cody has always
        been impressed with Matt's wordsmithing, foosball mastery, and general
        MacGuyver-like skills, such as building a remote control out of a wooden
        dowel. Matt now works in the energy business at Mansfield Oil in Denver.
      </p>
      <h3>BRANDON EBBERSON</h3>
      <p>
        Brandon is Cody's (not so) little brother. Brandon is in his first year
        of studying Agriculture at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. Loved by
        all, and always up for a good time, Brandon is enjoying his college
        years properly. When not in class or hanging out with his fraternity,
        Brandon can usually be found at the gym working out. Cody secretly hopes
        Brandon won't remember being picked on as a child.
      </p>

        over 15 years. Born in Ireland, he was awarded a B.Sc. degree (major in
        Mathematics) from the National University of Ireland. He spent 14 years
        in East Africa working in Education, Agriculture, Preventative Medicine,
        Famine Relief, and Architecture and also with physically disabled
        children. He is multi-lingual and has an M.A. and a Ph.D. in
        transpersonal psychology. He is a co-founder and the Spiritual Director
        of a group of Bay Area Catholics, called "Companions on the Journey,"
        who are attempting to find "a new way of being truly catholic." He is,
        also, a Clinical Psychologist,lectures, and conducts scientific research
        on the effects of prayer. His findings have been published in several
        research journals. In 1984, while living in Kenya, he wrote a book
        entitled Ukweli Ni Nini? (What does Truth Mean?) In 2003 he wrote,
        "Spirits in Spacesuits" and in 2006 he wrote, "Souls on Safari." In 2007
        this was translated and published in German as "Seelen Auf Safari."
